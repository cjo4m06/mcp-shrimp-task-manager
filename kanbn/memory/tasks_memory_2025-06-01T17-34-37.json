It also configures the default model and allowed origins.\n- `src/controller/mcp-controller.js`: This module is responsible for starting the MCP server. It instantiates `KanbnMcpServer` (from `../lib/mcp-server.js`) using the port and model from `McpConfig` and then calls `server.start()`. It logs the server status and handles graceful shutdown on SIGINT.\n\nKanbn can indeed start an MCP server, typically on port 11435.

      "summary": "Hypothesis on `mcp-test` Invocation and Connection Mechanism:\n\nBased on the available `MCP-Client-CLI` documentation and analysis of `kanbn`'s MCP configuration, the following hypothesis is proposed for how `mcp-test` *should* connect to an MCP server like `kanbn`:\n\n1.  **Target Server Running:** `mcp-test` likely expects the target MCP server (e.g., `kanbn`) to be already running and listening on a specific host and port before `mcp-test` is executed. It does not appear to have functionality to launch the target server itself.\n\n2.  **Configuration for Connection:** `mcp-test` requires configuration to know how to connect to the target server. This configuration can likely be provided in two ways:\n    *   **Configuration File:** Using a `--config <config-file.json>` command-line argument, as seen in examples like `mcp-test cross-language --config cross-language-config.json` (from <mcurl name=\"Cross-Language Compatibility\" url=\"https://tosin2013.github.io/mcp-client-cli/chapters/chapter11/\"></mcurl>). This JSON file would contain connection parameters such as hostname and port.\n    *   **Direct Command-Line Arguments:** While not explicitly detailed in the provided snippets for basic connection, testing frameworks often allow overriding or specifying core parameters like host and port directly via CLI flags. This would need further verification if a config file is not used.\n\n3.  **Connection Parameters:**\n    *   **Host:** The hostname or IP address of the machine running the `kanbn` MCP server (e.g., `localhost` for local testing).\n    *   **Port:** The port number on which the `kanbn` MCP server is listening. According to <mcfile name=\"mcp-config.js\" path=\"/Users/tosinakinosho/workspace/kanbn/src/config/mcp-config.js\"></mcfile>, `kanbn`'s MCP server defaults to port `11435`.\n\n**Expected Workflow for `mcp-test` with `kanbn`:**\n\n1.  Start the `kanbn` MCP server (e.g., by running a command like `node src/controller/mcp-controller.js` from the `/Users/tosinakinosho/workspace/kanbn/` directory).\n2.  Execute `mcp-test` with appropriate configuration pointing to `localhost:11435` (or the configured host/port for `kanbn`). For example: `mcp-test --config path/to/kanbn-mcp-test-config.json` where `kanbn-mcp-test-config.json` would specify the server address.\n\n**Potential Reasons for Past Failures (Connection Closed):**\n\n*   The `kanbn` MCP server was not running or not yet fully initialized when `mcp-test` attempted to connect.\n*   `mcp-test` was not provided with the correct host and port for the running `kanbn` MCP server.\n*   Underlying instability or bugs within `mcp-test` itself, as has been a recurring theme.\n\nThis hypothesis is based on standard practices for client-server testing tools and the provided documentation snippets for `MCP-Client-CLI`.",
