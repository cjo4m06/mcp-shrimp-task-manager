      "verificationCriteria": "The content of `jest.config.js` has been successfully retrieved and reviewed.",
      "analysisResult": "The primary objective is to execute tests for the `kanbn` project. Given the persistent issues with `mcp-test`, the most reliable approach is to utilize the project's native Jest testing framework. This is supported by the presence of a `\"test\": \"jest\"` script in `package.json`, a `jest.config.js` file, and a `test/` directory.",
      "summary": "Successfully retrieved and reviewed the content of `jest.config.js`. The configuration specifies separate projects for unit and integration tests, coverage settings, module name mapping, setup files, and a test timeout. This fulfills the task's verification criteria.",
