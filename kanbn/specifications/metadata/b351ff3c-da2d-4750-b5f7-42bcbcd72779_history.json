It outlines the pipeline's interaction with the project's source code in the `src/` directory and the tests in the `test/` directory. Furthermore, it aims to clarify the role and integration points of Dagger as a technology and the `MCP-Client-CLI` in the context of this pipeline and the overall testing and development workflow. The document should cover the pipeline's structure, key stages, dependencies, and how it utilizes Dagger functionalities. It should also explore the relationship and potential usage of `MCP-Client-CLI` for testing or interacting with services defined or managed by the Dagger pipeline.\n\nThis specification document outlines the design and implementation details for Specification for Dagger Pipeline, MCP-Client-CLI, Source, and Test Integration. It serves as a reference for development and a foundation for task planning.\n\n## Functional Requirements\n\nList the specific capabilities and behaviors that the feature must provide:\n\n-\n-\n-\n\n## Non-Functional Requirements\n\nList requirements related to quality attributes such as performance, security, usability, etc.:\n\n-\n-\n-\n\n## Technical Design\n\n### Architecture\n\nDescribe the high-level architecture and how this feature fits into the existing system:\n\n### Components\n\nList the main components that will be created or modified:\n\n### Data Flow\n\nDescribe how data flows through the system with this feature:\n\n### API Design {if: hasAPI}\n\nDocument the API endpoints, parameters, and responses:\n\n### Database Changes {if: hasDatabase}\n\nDescribe any changes to the database schema:\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\nList specific, testable criteria that must be met for this feature to be considered complete:\n\n-\n-\n-\n\n## Implementation Constraints\n\nList any constraints or limitations that must be considered during implementation:\n\n-\n-\n-\n\n## Open Questions\n\nList any unresolved questions or decisions that need to be made:\n\n-\n-\n-\n\n## Related Files/Context\n\nFiles and components that will be affected by this implementation:\n\n\n\n## Change History\n\n| Date | Author | Description |\n|------|--------|-------------|\n| 2025-06-01 | AI Assistant | Initial creation |\n"
