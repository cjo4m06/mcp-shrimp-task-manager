The goal is to define how these components will interact and how their integration will be verified.\n\nThis specification document outlines the design and implementation details for Dagger MCP-Client-CLI Integration Test Specification. It serves as a reference for development and a foundation for task planning.\n\n## Functional Requirements\n\nList the specific capabilities and behaviors that the feature must provide:\n\n-\n-\n-\n\n## Non-Functional Requirements\n\nList requirements related to quality attributes such as performance, security, usability, etc.:\n\n-\n-\n-\n\n## Technical Design\n\n### Architecture\n\nDescribe the high-level architecture and how this feature fits into the existing system:\n\n### Components\n\nList the main components that will be created or modified:\n\n### Data Flow\n\nDescribe how data flows through the system with this feature:\n\n### API Design {if: hasAPI}\n\nDocument the API endpoints, parameters, and responses:\n\n### Database Changes {if: hasDatabase}\n\nDescribe any changes to the database schema:\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\nList specific, testable criteria that must be met for this feature to be considered complete:\n\n-\n-\n-\n\n## Implementation Constraints\n\nList any constraints or limitations that must be considered during implementation:\n\n-\n-\n-\n\n## Open Questions\n\nList any unresolved questions or decisions that need to be made:\n\n-\n-\n-\n\n## Related Files/Context\n\nFiles and components that will be affected by this implementation:\n\n\n\n## Change History\n\n| Date | Author | Description |\n|------|--------|-------------|\n| 2025-06-01 | AI Assistant | Initial creation |\n"
