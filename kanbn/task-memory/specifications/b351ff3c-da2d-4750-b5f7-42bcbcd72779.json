      "content": "This specification details the CI/CD pipeline implemented with Dagger, located at `ci/dagger/index.ts` and executed via `npx tsx ci/dagger/index.ts`. It outlines the pipeline's interaction with the project's source code in the `src/` directory and the tests in the `test/` directory. Furthermore, it aims to clarify the role and integration points of Dagger as a technology and the `MCP-Client-CLI` in the context of this pipeline and the overall testing and development workflow. The document should cover the pipeline's structure, key stages, dependencies, and how it utilizes Dagger functionalities. It should also explore the relationship and potential usage of `MCP-Client-CLI` for testing or interacting with services defined or managed by the Dagger pipeline.\n\nThis specification document outlines the design and implementation details for Specification for Dagger Pipeline, MCP-Client-CLI, Source, and Test Integration. It serves as a reference for development and a foundation for task planning."
