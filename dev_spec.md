- **Main application controller and routing**
- **User interface components and views**
- **Data models and validation logic**
- **Service layer for business operations**
- **Database access and ORM integration**

### Data Flow

1. **User Input**: Interface captures user interactions and data
2. **Validation**: Input validation and sanitization
3. **Processing**: Business logic execution and data transformation
4. **Storage**: Database operations and state persistence
5. **Response**: Result formatting and user feedback


### API Design {if: hasAPI}

Document the API endpoints, parameters, and responses:

- **Authentication**: Secure API access with proper authentication mechanisms
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement appropriate rate limits for API endpoints
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error response format and status codes
- **Documentation**: OpenAPI/Swagger documentation for all endpoints
- **Versioning**: API versioning strategy for backward compatibility

### Database Changes {if: hasDatabase}

Describe any changes to the database schema:

- **Schema Updates**: New tables, columns, or indexes required
- **Data Migration**: Migration strategy for existing data
- **Performance**: Database query optimization and indexing
- **Backup Strategy**: Data backup and recovery procedures
- **Security**: Database access controls and encryption
