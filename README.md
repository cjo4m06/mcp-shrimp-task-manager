## 🧭 <a id="usage-guide"></a>Usage Guide

Shrimp Task Manager offers a structured approach to AI-assisted programming through guided workflows and systematic task management.

### What is Shrimp?

Shrimp is essentially a prompt template that guides AI Agents to better understand and work with your project. It uses a series of prompts to ensure the Agent aligns closely with your project's specific needs and conventions.

### Research Mode in Practice

Before diving into task planning, you can leverage the research mode for technical investigation and knowledge gathering. This is particularly useful when:

- You need to explore new technologies or frameworks
- You want to compare different solution approaches
- You're investigating best practices for your project
- You need to understand complex technical concepts

Simply tell the Agent "research [your topic]" or "enter research mode for [technology/problem]" to begin systematic investigation. The research findings will then inform your subsequent task planning and development decisions.

### First-Time Setup

When working with a new project, simply tell the Agent "init project rules". This will guide the Agent to generate a set of rules tailored to your project's specific requirements and structure.

### Task Planning Process

To develop or update features, use the command "plan task [your description]". The system will reference the previously established rules, attempt to understand your project, search for relevant code sections, and propose a comprehensive plan based on the current state of your project.

### Feedback Mechanism

During the planning process, Shrimp guides the Agent through multiple steps of thinking. You can review this process and provide feedback if you feel it's heading in the wrong direction. Simply interrupt and share your perspective - the Agent will incorporate your feedback and continue the planning process.

### Task Execution

When you're satisfied with the plan, use "execute task [task name or ID]" to implement it. If you don't specify a task name or ID, the system will automatically identify and execute the highest priority task.

### Continuous Mode

If you prefer to execute all tasks in sequence without manual intervention for each task, use "continuous mode" to automatically process the entire task queue.

### Token Limitation Note

Due to LLM token limits, context may be lost during lengthy conversations. If this occurs, simply open a new chat session and ask the Agent to continue execution. The system will pick up where it left off without requiring you to repeat the task details or context.

### Prompt Language and Customization

You can switch the language of system prompts by setting the `TEMPLATES_USE` environment variable. It supports `en` (English) and `zh` (Traditional Chinese) by default. Furthermore, you can copy an existing template directory (e.g., `src/prompts/templates_en`) to the location specified by `DATA_DIR`, modify it, and then point `TEMPLATES_USE` to your custom template directory name. This allows for deeper prompt customization. For detailed instructions.

## 🔬 <a id="research-mode"></a>Research Mode

Shrimp Task Manager includes a specialized research mode designed for systematic technical investigation and knowledge gathering.

### What is Research Mode?

Research Mode is a guided workflow system that helps AI Agents conduct thorough and systematic technical research. It provides structured approaches to exploring technologies, comparing solutions, investigating best practices, and gathering comprehensive information for programming tasks.

### Key Features

- **Systematic Investigation**: Structured workflows ensure comprehensive coverage of research topics
- **Multi-Source Research**: Combines web search and codebase analysis for complete understanding
- **State Management**: Maintains research context and progress across multiple sessions
- **Guided Exploration**: Prevents research from becoming unfocused or going off-topic
- **Knowledge Integration**: Seamlessly integrates research findings with task planning and execution

### When to Use Research Mode

Research Mode is particularly valuable for:

- **Technology Exploration**: Investigating new frameworks, libraries, or tools
- **Best Practices Research**: Finding industry standards and recommended approaches
- **Solution Comparison**: Evaluating different technical approaches or architectures
- **Problem Investigation**: Deep-diving into complex technical challenges
- **Architecture Planning**: Researching design patterns and system architectures

### How to Use Research Mode

Simply tell the Agent to enter research mode with your topic:

- **Basic usage**: "Enter research mode for [your topic]"
- **Specific research**: "Research [specific technology/problem]"
- **Comparative analysis**: "Research and compare [options A vs B]"

The system will guide the Agent through structured research phases, ensuring thorough investigation while maintaining focus on your specific needs.

### Research Workflow

1. **Topic Definition**: Clearly define the research scope and objectives
2. **Information Gathering**: Systematic collection of relevant information
3. **Analysis and Synthesis**: Processing and organizing findings
4. **State Updates**: Regular progress tracking and context preservation
5. **Integration**: Applying research results to your project context

> **💡 Recommendation**: For the best research mode experience, we recommend using **Claude 4 Sonnet**, which provides exceptional analytical capabilities and comprehensive research synthesis.

## 🧠 <a id="task-memory-function"></a>Task Memory Function

Shrimp Task Manager has long-term memory capabilities, automatically saving task execution history and providing reference experiences when planning new tasks.

### Key Features

- The system automatically backs up tasks to the memory directory
- Backup files are named in chronological order, in the format tasks_backup_YYYY-MM-DDThh-mm-ss.json
- Task planning Agents automatically receive guidance on how to use the memory function

### Advantages and Benefits

- **Avoid Duplicate Work**: Reference past tasks, no need to solve similar problems from scratch
- **Learn from Successful Experiences**: Utilize proven effective solutions, improve development efficiency

- **Knowledge Accumulation**: Form a continuously expanding knowledge base as system usage increases

Through effective use of the task memory function, the system can continuously accumulate experience, with intelligence level and work efficiency continuously improving.

## 📋 <a id="project-rules"></a>Project Rules Initialization

The Project Rules feature helps maintain consistency across your codebase:

- **Standardize Development**: Establish consistent coding patterns and practices
- **Onboard New Developers**: Provide clear guidelines for project contributions
- **Maintain Quality**: Ensure all code meets established project standards

> **⚠️ Recommendation**: Initialize project rules when your project grows larger or undergoes significant changes. This helps maintain consistency and quality as complexity increases.

Use the `init_project_rules` tool to set up or update project standards when:

- Starting a new large-scale project
- Onboarding new team members
- Implementing major architectural changes
- Adopting new development conventions

### Usage Examples

You can easily access this feature with simple natural language commands:

- **For initial setup**: Simply tell the Agent "init rules" or "init project rules"
- **For updates**: When your project evolves, tell the Agent "Update rules" or "Update project rules"

This tool is particularly valuable when your codebase expands or undergoes significant structural changes, helping maintain consistent development practices throughout the project lifecycle.

## 🔌 <a id="clients"></a>Using with MCP-Compatible Clients

Shrimp Task Manager can be used with any client that supports the Model Context Protocol, such as Cursor IDE. To connect, you need to point your client to the server's HTTP endpoint.

### Configuration in Cursor IDE

Update your global (`~/.cursor/mcp.json`) or project-specific (`.cursor/mcp.json`) configuration file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "shrimp-task-manager": {
      "url": "http://localhost:3000/mcp",
      "env": {
        "DATA_DIR": "/path/to/project/data", // Must be an absolute path accessible by the container
        "TEMPLATES_USE": "en"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### ⚠️ Important Configuration Notes

-   **`url`**: This should point to the `/mcp` endpoint of your running Shrimp Task Manager container.
-   **`DATA_DIR`**: This path must be the **absolute path on the host machine** that you want to map to the container's data volume. The `docker-compose.yml` file handles this mapping. Ensure this path exists and has the correct permissions.

### 🔧 Environment Variable Configuration

You can customize the server's behavior by modifying the `environment` section in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

-   **`MCP_PORT`**: The port the server listens on inside the container.
-   **`DATA_DIR`**: The path inside the container where task data is stored. This should match the volume mount path.
-   **`TEMPLATES_USE`**: Specifies the prompt template set to use (`en` or `zh`).

For more advanced prompt customization, see the [Prompt Customization Guide](docs/en/prompt-customization.md).

## 💡 <a id="prompt"></a>System Prompt Guidance

### Cursor IDE Configuration

You can enable Cursor Settings => Features => Custom modes, and configure the following two modes:

#### TaskPlanner Mode

```
You are a professional task planning expert. You must interact with users, analyze their needs, and collect project-related information. Finally, you must use "plan_task" to create tasks. When the task is created, you must summarize it and inform the user to use the "TaskExecutor" mode to execute the task.
You must focus on task planning. Do not use "execute_task" to execute tasks.
Serious warning: you are a task planning expert, you cannot modify the program code directly, you can only plan tasks, and you cannot modify the program code directly, you can only plan tasks.
```

#### TaskExecutor Mode

```
You are a professional task execution expert. When a user specifies a task to execute, use "execute_task" to execute the task.
If no task is specified, use "list_tasks" to find unexecuted tasks and execute them.
When the execution is completed, a summary must be given to inform the user of the conclusion.
You can only perform one task at a time, and when a task is completed, you are prohibited from performing the next task unless the user explicitly tells you to.
If the user requests "continuous mode", all tasks will be executed in sequence.
```

> 💡 Choose the appropriate mode based on your needs:
>
> - Use **TaskPlanner** mode when planning tasks
> - Use **TaskExecutor** mode when executing tasks

### Using with Other Tools

If your tool doesn't support Custom modes, you can:

- Manually paste the appropriate prompts at different stages
- Or directly use simple commands like `Please plan the following task: ......` or `Please start executing the task...`
