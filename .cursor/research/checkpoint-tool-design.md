# AI-Powered Checkpoint Tool: Agent–Expert Dialog Workflow (2024 Revision)

## Overview

This document describes the design and implementation of an intelligent "checkpoint" tool for agent-driven, consistent, and policy-compliant code commits. The workflow leverages an agent–expert dialog, ensuring all commit decisions are reviewed and improved by an expert (LLM or rules-based system) before execution. The user experience is streamlined: the user simply triggers `checkpoint`, and the agent and expert handle the rest.

---

## Motivation

Manual git commits are error-prone and inconsistent. Developers want atomic, meaningful commits that follow best practices, but manual grouping and message writing is tedious. This tool automates the process, ensuring every commit is reviewed for quality, security, and policy compliance—without burdening the user.

---

## High-Level Flow

1. **User triggers the checkpoint tool.**
2. **Agent gathers all git context:**
    - Uses `git status`, `git diff`, and `git log` to collect changed files, diffs, branch, and recent commits.
3. **Agent proposes a commit plan:**
    - Groups changes logically and drafts high-quality commit messages.
4. **Agent initiates a dialog with the expert (`consult_expert`):**
    - Sends a detailed prompt with diffs, commit plan, and explicit instructions for review.
    - The expert reviews, asks clarifying questions, and suggests improvements as needed.
    - The agent responds, refines the plan, and re-consults the expert until the expert replies with "Approved."
5. **Agent executes the commit plan:**
    - Only after explicit expert approval, the agent runs the git commands (add, commit, push).
6. **User receives a summary of the result.**

---

## Technical Considerations

- **All git operations are performed by the agent on the user's machine or CI environment.**
- **The expert is always consulted via the `consult_expert` tool.**
- **No user input is required beyond the initial `checkpoint` trigger.**
- **The agent–expert dialog can iterate as many times as needed for clarity and quality.**
- **All decisions, clarifications, and approvals are logged for traceability.**

## Sample Expert Prompt

> **Subject:** Review and Approve Commit Plan for Checkpoint
>
> **Context:**  
> The agent has detected the following git changes and proposes the following commit groups and messages.
>
> **Diff Summary:**  
> (Concise summary: number of files, types of changes)
>
> **Detailed Diffs:**  
> ```diff
> // Truncated diffs for each file/group
> ```
>
> **Proposed Commit Groups and Messages:**  
> ```json
> [
>   { "files": ["src/foo.js"], "message": "feat: add feature X" },
>   { "files": ["README.md"], "message": "docs: update usage" }
> ]
> ```
>
> **Instructions for Expert:**  
> - Please review the diffs and proposed commit plan.
> - Check for:
>   - Logical and conventional grouping of changes.
>   - Clear, actionable, and conventional commit messages.
>   - Adherence to project or team conventions.
>   - Security or policy issues (e.g., secrets, sensitive data, large or unintended changes).
>   - Any other improvements or risks.
> - If anything is unclear, ask clarifying questions—the agent will respond and iterate as needed.
> - When you are satisfied, reply with "Approved" and any final notes.
>
> **Your feedback will be incorporated before any commits are made. The agent will not proceed until you are satisfied.**

## Benefits of This Workflow

- **User Simplicity:** The user only triggers `checkpoint`—no manual git or commit message work.
- **Agent Autonomy:** The agent handles all technical details, grouping, and message writing.
- **Expert Oversight:** Every commit is reviewed for quality, security, and policy compliance.
- **Dialog-Driven:** The agent and expert can iterate as needed for clarity and correctness.
- **Traceability:** All decisions and approvals are logged.
- **Extensible:** The expert can be upgraded to include more rules, human review, or advanced LLMs.

---

## Future Enhancements
- Integrate with issue trackers for smarter context.
- Support for monorepos and multi-language projects.
- Add dry-run/report mode for transparency.
- Allow configuration of grouping strategy or commit policy.

*This document supersedes all previous checkpoint tool designs. The agent–expert dialog is now the canonical workflow for consistent, high-quality, and policy-compliant code commits.*
