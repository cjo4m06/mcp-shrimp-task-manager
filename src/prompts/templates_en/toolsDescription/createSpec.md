# Create Specification Tool

This tool transforms raw ideas into structured specifications (dev_spec.md) by performing deep codebase analysis, integrating with project rules, and providing a foundation for task planning.

## Key Features

- **Deep Codebase Analysis**: Analyzes code structure, data flow, and dependency graphs
- **Smart Focusing**: Identifies the most relevant parts of the codebase for your idea
- **Project Rules Integration**: Automatically incorporates project standards and rules
- **Structured Documentation**: Creates comprehensive specification documents
- **Workflow Continuity**: Preserves context when developers pause and resume work

## Usage

Provide a title and detailed description of your feature or idea. Optionally, you can specify a scope to limit the analysis to specific parts of the codebase, and a template to use for the specification.

## Parameters

- **title**: Title of the specification (required)
- **description**: Detailed description of the feature or idea (required)
- **scope**: Optional scope to limit codebase analysis (e.g., directory path)
- **template**: Optional template name to use (defaults to 'default-template')

## Example

```json
{
  "title": "User Authentication System",
  "description": "Implement a secure user authentication system with login, registration, password reset, and session management. The system should use JWT tokens and support OAuth providers.",
  "scope": "src/auth"
}
```

## Output

The tool will generate a structured specification document (dev_spec.md) with sections for overview, requirements, technical design, acceptance criteria, and more. It will also perform codebase analysis to identify affected components and dependencies.

## Workflow Integration

After creating a specification, you can use the `plan_task` tool to break it down into implementable tasks.
