feat(tools): add context-aware translation tool with learning capabilities

- Add translate_content tool for intelligent, context-aware translations
- Implement agent-to-agent dialog for disambiguation
- Create persistent translation memory system
- Support multiple domains (education, finance, technical, etc.)
- Include comprehensive test suite and documentation

The tool learns from past translations to improve consistency and quality
over time. All translations are persisted in DATA_DIR/translation_memory/
and automatically referenced in future translations.

BREAKING CHANGE: Requires OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable
